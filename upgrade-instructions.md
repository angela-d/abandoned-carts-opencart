# Upgrade Instructions #

* Download the .ocmod.zip (either from OpenCart Marketplace, or Github and ensure you have the latest version number; unless you wish to downgrade) and upload it similarly to how you did while initially installing

* You will be prompted with a list of files that will be "replaced" (all will be files native to this extension; click Continue to proceed)

* Head to Modifications on the navigation menu -> **DISABLE** any previous versions of Abandoned Carts, while leaving the latest (highest version number) active - this will not disable the **extension**, but only the old codebase that is cached by the system.
* Also in modifications, clear cache (orange button, then blue button on the right)

You should now be upgraded to the latest version.
